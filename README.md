# Time Series Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model for time series prediction. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data and learn long-term dependencies, making it ideal for time series forecasting tasks.  

## About LSTM  
LSTM is a deep learning architecture that addresses the limitations of traditional RNNs, such as the vanishing gradient problem. It utilizes memory cells, gates (input, forget, and output), and a cell state to selectively retain or discard information over time. This makes it particularly powerful for predicting sequences and trends in data like stock prices, weather forecasting, and more.  

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, scaling, and shaping time series data for LSTM input.  
- **LSTM Model Implementation**: Multi-layer LSTM architecture built using TensorFlow/Keras.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjustable parameters like the number of layers, neurons, activation functions, and learning rate.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  
- **Visualization**: Comparison of actual vs. predicted values through charts and graphs.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**: For scripting and development.  
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: To build, train, and evaluate the LSTM model.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing predictions and trends.
